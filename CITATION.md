In the meantime, you can cite this work as, either:

```
CMS Collaboration, Higgs Combination Tool, http://cms-analysis.github.io/HiggsAnalysis-CombinedLimit/
```

Or one of the last Higgs combination paper, for instance:

```
CMS Collaboration, "A portrait of the Higgs boson by the CMS experiment", Nature 607 (2022) 60, doi:10.1038/s41586-022-04892-x.
```

## Specific method or Models
Some models or methods should cite the original article. 
A collection of them is avaible in the documentation http://cms-analysis.github.io/HiggsAnalysis-CombinedLimit/
or in the model files, from which the model is derived.
